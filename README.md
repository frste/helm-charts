# helm-charts

This is the helm chart repo mainly used to create the selenium-docker helm chart for my bachelorthesis.

It is based on [SeleniumHQ]'s basic k8s deployment [yaml file].

[SeleniumHQ]: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ
[yaml file]: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/blob/trunk/k8s-deployment-full-grid.yaml

[Check selenium helm chart readme](charts/selenium-grid/README.md)
